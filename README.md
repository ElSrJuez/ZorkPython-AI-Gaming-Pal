## Features
| Category | Highlights |
|---|---|
| **Authentic Zork Gameplay** | Complete port of Zork I: all rooms, puzzles, treasures, troll, thief, etc. (see `zork_expanded.py`). |
| **AI Gaming Pal** | OpenAI-compatible model (local or cloud) produces structured JSON with: `game-intent`, `game-meta-intent`, `hidden-next-command`, `hidden-next-command-confidence`, and `narration`. |
| **Rich Two-Pane UI** | Left = original game transcript. Right = AI narrator streaming in real time with colour-alternating blocks (`zork_ui.py`). |
| **Structured-Output Pipeline** | `completions.py` injects `response_schema.json` into the prompt, requests strict JSON, logs every turn, and streams narration (or full JSON for debugging). |
| **Config Toggles** | `config.json` controls model prompt, token limits, and `stream_only_narration` switch. |

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ZorkPython.git
$ cd ZorkPython

# 2. Install dependencies (Python 3.9+ recommended)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch
$ python zork_expanded.py
```
The Rich interface appears; type Zork commands at the bottom prompt.

## Playing the Game

### Basic Parser Commands
* Movement: `n`/`s`/`e`/`w`, `u`/`d`, `in`, `out` …
* Interaction: `take lamp`, `open door`, `examine mailbox`, `put egg in basket` …
* Utility: `look`, `inventory`, `save`, `restore`, `score`, `quit`.

### AI Companion
* By default **full JSON** is streamed so you can see each field for debugging.
* Set `"stream_only_narration": true` in `config.json` to see just the narration.
* The AI never spoils puzzles; it offers concise hints in the structured fields.

### Tips
1. Map the underground – mazes get tricky.
2. Watch lamp battery life (≈ 330 turns).
3. Save before risky actions.
4. The thief is… opportunistic.

## Architecture & Configuration
```
├─ completions.py          # Builds prompts, injects schema, parses LLM JSON
├─ zork_ai_controllers.py  # Orchestrates UI ↔︎ completion service
├─ zork_ui.py              # Rich TUI (game left, AI right)
├─ response_schema.json    # Strict schema enforced on every AI reply
├─ config.json             # System prompt template & runtime flags
└─ log/ai.jsonl            # Every request/response for analysis
```
Key `config.json` fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `system_prompt` | Contains `{response_schema}` placeholder replaced at runtime. |
| `user_prompt_template` | Wraps last N game lines into the user message. |
| `stream_only_narration` | Toggle between full JSON or just narration streaming. |
| `max_tokens` | Optional limit for LLM response length. |

## TODO

1. **Eliminate prompt flicker** – optimise Rich `Live` updates.
2. **Filter banner noise** – exclude Zork’s welcome/header lines from LLM prompts.
3. **Command skip-list** – maintain commands that shouldn’t trigger AI calls (e.g. `save`, `restore`, `quit`).
4. **Second-stage narration** – feed the first-instance structured JSON so that the narration is an experience enhancing second-shot narration.
5. **Inventory helper** – AI suggests useful items or combos based on current state.
6. **Emergency auto-rescue** – when confidence is high, AI may issue an occasional lifesaving command on behalf of the player.
7. **Voice Narration** - Implement TTS (Piper, other) narration and optionally hiding the AI Box
